# Identifier

## Definiations

- A Python Identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object
- An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore `(_)` followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9)
- Python is a case sensitive programming language
- Python does not allow special characters such as `@`, `$` and `%` within identifiers

## Naming Conventions

### Class Name

- Class names starts with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter

### Single Leading Underscore

- Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private

### Two Leading Underscores

- Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier

### Two Trailing Underscores

- If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name
