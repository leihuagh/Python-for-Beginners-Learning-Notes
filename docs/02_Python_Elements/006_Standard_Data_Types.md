# Standard Data Types

## Types

- Values cannot be changed (Immutable Data Types)
- Values can be changed (Mutable Data Types)

## Immutable Data Types

- Numbers
- Strings
- Tuples

### Numeric Data Type

- Python supports three different numerical values
  - int (Signed Integers)
  - float (Real Numbers)
  - Complex Numbers
- In Python you can represent `Numbers` in multiple ways:
  - Binary
  - Octal
  - Hexadecimal

### String - Immutable Data Type

- The continuous set of characters represented within quotation is called as String.
- Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes.
- Pythong does not support a character type, these are treated as strings of length one
- Python canot differentiate between single and double quotes

### Tuples - Immutable Data Type

- Tuples consists of a number of values separated by comma. It is enclosed within parenthesis
- Unlike Arrays in `C`, A Tuple can have objects of different data types
- Exmple:

```python
A = (1, 2, 3.5, 'Education')
print(A)
```

## Mutable Data Types

- Lists
