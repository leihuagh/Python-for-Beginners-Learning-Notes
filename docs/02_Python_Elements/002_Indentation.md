# Indentation

## No Braces

- Non braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control

## Blocks of Code

- Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced

## The Number of Spaces

- The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount

## Leading Whitespace

- Leading whitespace at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indetation level of the line, which in turn, is used to determine the grouping of statements
